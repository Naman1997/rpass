## rpass

### This project is still a work in progress!

An extremely simple password manager script that uses gnugpg under the hood to encrypt and git to manage encrypted creds in a private repo.

Note: Please make sure to backup your secret keys. rpass does not manage your keys - you should use gpg for this. A doc will soon be added that expalins this process.

Note: It's a good idea to make sure that the git repo you provide to rpass is private.
